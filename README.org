* Introduction
Sample project on how to do data extraction/visualization in Arbor.

Setup like this
#+begin_src sh
bash setup-env.sh
source env/bin/activate
#+end_src

To run, ensure the venv is active and then
#+begin_src sh
python main.py
#+end_src
should produce a HDF5 file named ~results.h5~ with the following layout

- cell id
  - probe id
    - time: N floats, one per per sample timepoint
    - x: M floats, one per sample location
    - y: M floats, one per sample location
    - z: M floats, one per sample location
    - samples
      - 0: N floats, one per per sample timepoint
      - ...
      - M-1: N floats, one per per sample timepoint

Thus to obtain the samples for cell ~c~, probe ~p~ on the second point, one would
index ~/c/p/samples/1~.

Units and measured quantities are attached to the respective groups as attributes.
